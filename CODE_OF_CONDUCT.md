# Code of Conduct

IndieWeb [***code of conduct***](https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct) tl;dr:

> Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue contact staff. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.

Based on previous [excellent work by others](https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct-examples), this is a living code of conduct. This code of conduct applies to all IndieWeb spaces both online and off, including our events, IRC channel, and wiki.

## Respect

IndieWeb is an intentionally positive community that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent creators (and independence) and the diversity of people, cultures, and opinions that they bring to IndieWeb.

IndieWeb spaces are an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, medical conditions, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), physical appearance, politics, ideology (real world or tech), or software preferences.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes:

* Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming.

## Resolve Peacefully

We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior and feel in any way unable to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an organizer. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just icky in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

## Apologize for Mistakes

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, and avoiding repeating them in the future.

## Consequences

If the organizers determine that an event participant is behaving disrespectfully, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the event without warning or refund.

As organizers, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can't foresee every situation however, and thus if in the organizers' judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so. We've never had to do so; please don't be the first.

## Thanks

Thank you to every IndieWeb community member for helping making IndieWeb the respectful and inclusive community that it is.
