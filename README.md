# Purpose
This repo is to track general requests for features in the WordPress plugin ecosystem. Most of the IndieWeb plugins are personal projects and it can be confusing to know where a feature belongs or is outside of an existing plugin.

Please use this issue tracker for feature requests only. Issues with specific plugins should be directed to that repo, or visit us in [IRC or Slack](https://indieweb.org/discuss#Chat). We'd love to meet you!
